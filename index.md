## Vision

The Functional Programming (FP) Launchpad at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) aims to build research and educational capacity for crafting **efficient, reliable and trustworthy software with mathematical guardrails**. As AI coding agents make software increasingly accessible and enable its production at unprecedented scale, they also introduce far-reaching consequences for civic society. In this context, the centre is founded on the belief that discovering future software engineering best practices requires sustained feedback loops between research and real-world systems, as well as educational structures that cultivate a new generation of maintainers for foundational software.
